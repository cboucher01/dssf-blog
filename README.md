# [DSSF 2022 Blog Site](https://cboucher01.github.io/dssf-blog/)

## Site function

The Digital Scholarship Summer Fellow Blog was a beginner project for the fellows to develop our web-development skills while creating a site to host our blog posts and information about us and the digital web design toolkit that we are currently building. 

### Which kinds of code did we use?
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript/Bootstrap
- Jekyll/Ruby
  
- Challenges faced / potential changes for the future?

## Working with Minima
This site was created by editing Minima, Jekyll's first and default theme. As the default theme, Minima was a useful resource for developing the DSSF 2022 blog.

Though there were various aesthetic changes made to the layout, navigation bar, background, post box, titles, headers, and more, portions of our site still rely on Minima to operate.

You can compare our code and find out more about Minima [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

## How-to install and run

## How to make a site like this one
- Adding collections (like fellows)
- How to do a navbar like ours
- Changing SCSS files to change the look of the site
- Creating our own skin based on the skins that come with Minima
- The creature background (what we did and how you might do it better with vectors instead of raster images)
