One of our first assignments as a team was to design and code a blogsite to host information about our project this summer and blog posts from each intern throughout that process (hint: this *is* that website). Working together, we started out with the basic Minima template from the website-builder tool Jekyll and edited it to create the website that you see in front of you! As sleek and simple as this site may look, the coding process was far from sleek and simple...

It has been a challenging and slow process, especially when working through past errors that kept on persisting or new errors that popped up. In my branch, for example, my website stopped loading properly and only displayed an index of the site's HTML files instead of the actual site itself as it is supposed to be interpreted. In fact, most of the time on this project was spent debugging code, troubleshooting errors, and navigating the web that is the minima design template. 

After a week of work on this site, getting through another day at work feels like an accomplishment in itself. The site-building process has given me a sense of pride in myself for sticking it through despite the unexpected ups and downs. Even if the learning process is not straightforward, simply showing up each day ready and trying my best has helped me build more confidence in my ability to learn new programs and ways of working with data and coding. If coding feels daunting to you, just remember that challenges are a normal and necessary part of the learning process.
